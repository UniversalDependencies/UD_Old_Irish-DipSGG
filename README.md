# Summary

A Universal Dependencies treebank for the Old Irish glosses of St. Gall.


# Introduction

The Diplomatic St. Gall Glosses Treebank (DipSGG) has been compiled as part of a PhD research project by Adrian Doyle at the National University of Ireland, Galway. These glosses were written about the middle of the 9th century in Latin and Old Irish. Only those glosses which contain some Irish text are collected here, however, many of these include code-mixing between Irish and Latin. The subject of these glosses is the Latin Grammar of Priscianus Caesariensis.

The Old Irish text has been drawn from Bernhard Bauer's work on these glosses which was carried out originally for his project, A Dictionary of the Old Irish Priscian Glosses, in 2015, and supplemented with Latin text from Rijcklof Hofman’s The Sankt Gall Priscian Commentary (1996). The POS tags have, for the most part, been converted from Bauer’s morphological analysis of this Irish text. Both of these resources are available through the St Gall Glosses Database (www.stgallpriscian.ie), produced and hosted by Pádraic Moran.

The conversion from Bauer's annotation scheme to the UD annotation scheme was carried out by Adrian Doyle, during which time some revisions were made to the analysis, manuscript reading, and translation of some glosses. Glosses in the Ogam script were produced specifically for this treebank by Doyle as all earlier editions render them transliterated into the Roman alphabet.

The UD Treebank contains 3,471 glosses. Because of the rarity of Old Irish text surviving in manuscripts from the period, these have not been split into test, dev and train sets.
